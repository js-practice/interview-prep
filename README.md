This repo is a place to share interview questions and get some practice with them.


# Contributing Questions

To contribute you need to fork the repo to your own GitHub.

Clone the repo to your local machine.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAMEHERE/interview-prep
```

Cut a new feature branch, named after the question

```sh
git checkout -b BRANCHNAME
```

Create a new folder for your practice problem with the name of the problem
and create a new JavaScript file in that folder.

```sh
fizzBuzz-
  fizzBuzz.js
```

Every JavaScript file should have a comment block at the top explaining the prompt
and the basic function with any arguments that it would take.  Run time examples also
must be provided. Remember to NOT include the solutions. For example:

```sh
# /**
#  * This function takes an argument that is a number and
#  * returns true if that number is a perfect square.
#  *
#  * Examples:
#  *  perfectSquareFinder(25); //true
#  *  perfectSquareFinder(26); //false
#  *
#  *
#  */
#
# var perfectSquareFinder = function(num){
#   //TODO: implement solution
# };
```
After you have completed the prompt, you should add the new JavaScript file you
created. PLEASE DO NOT INCLUDE SOLUTIONS and DO NOT include any previous work on other practice problems. If you
include other code, your pull request will be closed.

```sh
git add NEWPROBLEM
git commit
git push origin BRANCHNAME
```
